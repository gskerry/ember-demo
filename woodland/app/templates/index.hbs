<h3>
    Hello from Index.
</h3>
{{!-- <a href="/orders">Orders</a>   --}} {{!-- works... but triggers a full page refresh --}}
{{#link-to "orders" class="orders-link"}}Orders{{/link-to}}
{{!-- actually renders to DOM essentially as above. But ember watches for click event and basically intercepts the handler --}}
